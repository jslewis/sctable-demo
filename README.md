#Overview

This is a simple Sproutcore demo app for the [SCTable](http://www.github.com/jslewis/sctable) project, a table view for Sproutcore.

Click [here](http://jslewis.github.com/sctable-demo/) to play with it.

#Dependencies

Make sure you add these frameworks:

  * [__Sproutcore__](http://www.github.com/sproutcore/sproutcore) (version 1.4 stable officially, though as far as I've tested, the current state of 1.5 also works)
  * [__SCTable__](http://www.github.com/jslewis/sctable)

to your 'frameworks' folder before you run this project on your local machine.
